# Logseq Calibre Plugins

- calibreMetadata
https://github.com/duydl/logseq-calibre-metadata

- calibreAnnotation
https://github.com/duydl/logseq-calibre-annotation

Enhance your note-taking experience with Logseq by integrating it with [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/), a robust e-book management software. These plugins utilize Calibre's Server API to provide a seamless e-book reading and note-taking experience within Logseq.

These two plugins can function independently. The `calibreMetadata` plugin only inserts the macros used by the `calibreAnnotation` plugin. 

Without `calibreMetadata`, you can still manually create links to your books. 

Without `calibreAnnotation`, you'll have a block with two non-functional renderer macros after creating page.

- Calibre Content Server is a very convenient tool. Add annotations to your books in a browser or on any other device, and the annotations will seamlessly sync to the page.

## Installation

## Usage

The `calibreAnnotation` plugin adds two button renderers for `calibreViewer` and `calibreSync`.

- `{{renderer calibreViewer, color, link}}`: This button opens a book viewer on the right-hand side. You could close the viewer, edit the viewer width, or open the book in browser with the control bar.

- `{{renderer calibreSync, syncstate, interval, hostlink, lib, id, fmt}}`: This button initiates the sync process, fetching annotations and applying them to the corresponding blocks in real-time.

You can click on the button again to stop syncing. If needed, you can copy the content to a new block, and it will only sync the latest position as recorded by `lastsync` property of the block.


## Future Enhancements

- Add location property to highlights to sort by location instead of timestamp
- Add more customized settings
- Adapt to other webtool. Omnivore Highlight, Youtube Timestamp, etc. 
- Add multiple iframe to side viewer. Save state of all opened iframe when new one opened.
